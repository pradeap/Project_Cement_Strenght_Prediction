# Project_Cement_Strength_Prediction

<b>Objective</b>

To built a machine learning regression model to predict the concrete compressive strength based on the features such as Blast Furnace, Fly Ash, Water Component, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate and Age. The output compressive strength  is in the units of MPa.
